# Calculator

Created a simple calculator program in java that takes user input from the command line, parses the input to deduce what operation to perform, and prints out the result to the console. The program includes error-checking to see if there are too many left or right parenthesis, if there are too many or too few operators, and if there are too many or too few operands.
